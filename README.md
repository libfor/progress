**Progress monitoring** is a crucial part of many applications, and deserves a simple, standardized interface. 

The `progress.Reader` interface **aims to be just that**.

```go
progress.Reader interface
    DoneChan() (done chan struct{}, completed bool)
    Count() (finished uint64, total uint64)
```

To drive adoption and provide practical utility, we've also included handy tools right out of the box! üì¶

### `progress.NewLongRunningJob`

**ü§© If you like the idea, here's the fastest way to expose a progress.Reader.**

This concurrency-safe utility makes instrumenting your long-running functions with a Reader implementation absolutely painless. Support progress and make your library consumers extremely happy!

### `progress.Extend(Reader)`

This simple wrapper adds helpful functions to a Reader, such as estimating the remaining time:

```go
PerSecond() float64
Remaining() time.Duration
Percentage() float64
InProgress() bool
```

### `progress.Logger(Reader)`

Instantly start a goroutine that keeps an eye on a Reader and logs informative updates! üëÄ Here's what it looks like today:

```yaml
searching:  49% (20.69/s, 1.256483582s remaining)
searching:  56% (18.01/s, 1.221804358s remaining)
searching:  80% (20.37/s, 490.981158ms remaining)
searching: 100% (21.98/s, 0s remaining)
```

### `progress.WaitGroup`

Drop in replacement for sync.WaitGroup that satisfies the Reader interface.

## üìù Todo List

Here's some simple ideas for those looking to contribute.

- [x] Satisfy `progress.Reader` with just a count.
- [ ] Return a `progress.Reader` from a slice or channel.
- [ ] Create a pretty terminal progress bar.
- [ ] Experiment with passing return types through.
